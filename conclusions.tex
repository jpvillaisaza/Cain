\todo{(Future work) The reasoning of Remark
  \ref{re:triple-endofunctor} also applies for an
  \texthaskell{Applicative} type constraint in the \texthaskell{Monad}
  type class. In this case, it makes real practical sense to include
  it.}

%% From Natural transformations

\todo{The relation between natural transformations and parametrically
  polymorphic functions is not as straightforward as discussed here.
  Polymorphic functions actually correspond to lax natural
  transformations, but this fact is beyond the scope of this
  dissertation.}

%% From Algebras

\todo{We are only concerned with inductive types, not coinductive.}
