\todo{``One does not so much learn category theory as absorb it over a
  period of time. It is difficult, at a first or second reading, to
  appreciate the point of many definitions and the reasons for the
  subject's abstract nature. We have tried to take this into account
  in two ways: first, by adopting a strictly minimalist style, leaving
  out anything that is not germane to our purpose; and second, by
  confining attention to a small range of examples''
  \parencite[26]{bird-demoor-1997}.}

\todo{``Developed in the 1940s as a way to organize constructs in
  algebraic topology, category theory works at a level of whole
  mathematical objects rather than their elements''
  \parencite[1154]{wolfram-2002}.}

\todo{``Category theory can be viewed as a formalization of operations
  on abstract data types in computer languages''
  \parencite[1154]{wolfram-2002}.}

\todo{When speaking of Haskell, we refer to GHC. Important, for
  instance, when mentioning language options such
  as \texttt{KindSignatures}.}

\todo{We refer to GHC 7.4.2 and the Haskell platform 2012.4.0.0.}

\todo{We refer to Agda 2.3.2 and the Agda standard library 0.7.}

\todo{Mention abstract nonsense.}

\todo{Prerequisite: Haskell or some of the concepts in a functional
  programming language (Functors, monads, polymorphic functions,
  etcetera) and Agda. Refer to tutorials.}

\todo{How about assuming something like the following:}
\begin{codehaskell}
import Prelude ()
\end{codehaskell}

\todo{Mention Abel. I deleted that chapter.}

``The trinity of concepts category, functor, and natural
transformation is what category theory is built on''
\parencite{nlab-category-theory}.

\todo{Each chapter has a similar structure. A motivation, theory, and
  Haskell. Some chapters include an analysis in Agda.}
