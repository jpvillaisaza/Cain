\chapter{Abstract}
\label{chap:abstract}

We study some of the applications of category theory to functional
programming in Haskell and Agda. More specifically, we describe and
explain the concepts of category theory needed for conceptualizing and
better understanding algebraic data types and folds, functors, monads,
and parametrically polymorphic functions. With this purpose, we give a
detailed account of categories, functors and endofunctors, natural
transformations, monads and Kleisli triples, algebras and initial
algebras over endofunctors, among others. In addition, we explore all
of these concepts from the standpoints of categories and programming
in Haskell and, in some cases, Agda. In other words, we examine
functional programming through category theory.
