Undergraduate project submitted in partial fulfillment of the
requirements for the degree of Systems Engineering at EAFIT.

It is possible to conceptualize many concepts of functional
programming via the study of category theory. So this project aims to
develop a monographical study of category theory which allows to
describe and explain some of the applications to functional
programming.

Our goal is to describe and explain some of the applications of
category theory to functional programming. More specifically, to
describe and explain the concepts of category theory which allow to
conceptualize and better understand the following concepts of
functional programming: polymorphism, algebraic data types, and the
functor and monad type classes.
