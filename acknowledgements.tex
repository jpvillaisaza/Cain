I'm very grateful to my supervisor, Andrés Sicard Ramírez, especially
for introducing me to category theory and functional programming, to
my parents, Ana María Isaza Builes and Carlos Fernando Villa Gómez,
and to my boyfriend and proofreader, Nicolás Arbeláez Estrada. I thank
you all for your support and encouragement, and for not running out of
patience with me. And last but not least, I'm very thankful to the
examiners, Francisco José Correa Zabala and Juan Francisco Cardona
McCormick, to the previous and current Systems Engineering
undergraduate projects coordinators, Hernán Darío Toro Escobar and
Edwin Nelson Montoya Múnera, respectively, to the EAFIT Logic and
Computation seminar 2013 attendees, and to my psychologist, María
Paula Valderrama López.
